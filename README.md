This project details procedures and metodologies used to detect irregular workers with Machine Learning algorithms.


The first part of this work was developed by the Labour Inspectors Jefferson Toledo and Robson Timoteo that used several characterists of brazilian work organizations to identity the probability of eath city and economic sector of having irregular workers.

With this set that works as a previous K-means classificator, I continue the research trying to identity the companies that donÂ´t comply brazilian working regulamentations.
